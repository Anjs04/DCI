## 0. Introduction
**415 We invite you to participate in a research project that is being conducted by Western Sydney University, in partnership with Google Australia. The project is titled "Digital Capacities Index Pilot: measuring the digital capacity of Australian families". We are investigating how people connect, participate, work, learn and stay safe using digital technologies and the ways families, communities, institutions and governments support individuals and communities to engage with digital devices, content, media and infrastructure. This survey includes questions about your access to and use of technology, and how this relates to /impacts on other aspects of your life.The information collected as part of this research project will help the researchers inform policy-makers, service-providers and others about the ways in which digital life is experienced by individuals, families and communities, and the kinds of support that might enhance their experience and allow them to maximize the benefits of digital devices, content, media and infrastructure. By participating in this project and providing information on your household's digital practices, you will be contributing to discussions that could potentially lead to improvements in policy, products and services for the benefit of the wider community.You and/or the other members of your household are free to stop the survey at any time without needing to give any reason, and your answers will not be used. Withdrawing from the study will not adversely affect your relationship with Western Sydney University or Google Australia. In the event that you withdraw, all written and audio records of the relevant person's participation will be destroyed.This survey is anonymous and publications or other research outputs will only report the information in such a way that is not traceable to the individual respondents. Completion of the survey will be taken as formal consent to participate in the study and have your answers included in the analysis. The survey should take no more than 20 minutes to complete.If you have questions about the study or your involvement, please contact Amanda Third, Project Leader on  a.third@westernsydney.edu.au.This project has the approval of Western Sydney University's Human Research Ethics Committee [Approval No. [INSERT XXXXX]. If you have any complaints or reservations about the ethical conduct of this research, you may contact Western Sydney University's Human Ethics Officer on +61 2 4736 0229 or humanethics@westernsydney.edu.au. Any issues you raise will be treated in confidence and investigated fully, and you will be informed of the outcome.  **
